# Hi, I'm Yash Chindhe

I'm a **Data & AI Engineer in the making** who builds **data pipelines, automation systems, and analytics platforms**

I care about **systems that run reliably**, **data that makes decisions**, and **automation that removes humans from boring work**.

---

## What I Actually Do

- Build **end-to-end ETL pipelines** using Azure Data Factory
- Design **event-driven systems** using Kafka and microservices
- Automate operational workflows using **Python + Jenkins**
- Turn messy raw data into **business-ready analytics**

---

## Tech Stack (Stuff I’ve Actually Used)

**Languages**
- Python, SQL (MySQL), Shell

**Data & ML**
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLTK

**Data Engineering**
- Databricks, Azure Data Factory, ADLS Gen2

**Streaming & Observability**
- Kafka, Beats, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana

**DevOps & CI/CD**
- Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Pytest, Azure, AWS

**Visualization**
- Power BI, Excel, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## How I Think

- Automation > manual work  
- Pipelines > scripts  
- Data quality > model complexity  
- Systems that fail loudly > systems that fail silently

If it doesn't scale, isn't testable, or can't be monitored — I’m not interested.
