# Hi, I'm Yash Chindhe

I'm a **Data & AI Engineer in the making** who builds **data pipelines, automation systems, and analytics platforms**

I care about **systems that run reliably**, **data that makes decisions**, and **automation that removes humans from boring work**.

## How I Think

- Automation > manual work  
- Pipelines > scripts  
- Data quality > model complexity  
- Systems that fail loudly > systems that fail silently

If it doesn't scale, isn't testable, or can't be monitored — I’m not interested.
